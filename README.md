vimrc
=======

my `vimrc` configuration.

## Requirements

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used for plugin handling/management.

## Extending

There is currently support for a `vimrc.local` file for local configurations/overrides to exist.

For bundles there is support for a `vimrc.bundles.local` for including/removing any bundles you'd like.

## [language].vim

Idea taken from [here](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indenting_source_code). These will need to be symlinked (or copied/moved) manually. They're just listed in the root directory
